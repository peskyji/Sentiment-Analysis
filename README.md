## Overview

Sentiment Analyzer for Movie Reviews is a comprehensive tool designed to evaluate the sentiment of movie reviews. This project is an integral part of the [Movie Counsel](https://movie-counsel.streamlit.app) web application, which empowers users to explore and discover movies tailored to their preferences.

**Key Features:**

- Sentiment Analyzer is implemented as a robust API using the FastAPI framework.
- The API is hosted on the Render cloud platform, ensuring scalability, reliability, and ease of deployment.
- Sentiment analysis models are trained on a vast dataset comprising approximately 180,000 movie reviews sourced from IMDB.
- The reviews are scrapped from IMDB for both Hollywood and Bollywood releases from 2019 to September 2023 with help of Beautiful Soup.

## Data Preprocessing

The heart of any sentiment analysis model is the quality of its training data. Therefore, the dataset undergoes a rigorous preprocessing phase to optimize its quality for analysis.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Tasks Include:**

- Correcting data formats to ensure uniformity and consistency with help of Pandas.
- Assigning review labels, i.e., classifying reviews as positive or negative based on the accompanying ratings.
- Removing special characters and symbols from the text, facilitating more accurate sentiment analysis.
- Applying word stemming techniques to further enhance the quality of the text data with help of nltk.

## Model Building

Sentiment Analyzer leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to create an accurate and robust sentiment classification model.

**Model Building Highlights:**

- Combination of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Complement Naive Bayes, and XGBoost, to achieve precise sentiment classification.
- Incorporation of pretrained models such as roBERTa to expedite the training process and enhance overall performance.
- Continuous model evaluation and refinement to ensure the highest level of sentiment analysis accuracy.

## Web API

To make sentiment analysis accessible and user-friendly, Sentiment Analyzer provides a comprehensive web API. Users can interact with the API to gain insights into the sentiment of movie reviews.

**Key API Features:**

- Accepts HTTP POST requests containing movie reviews as input.
- Returns the probability of both negative and positive sentiments predicted by each model.
- Enables users to integrate sentiment analysis capabilities into their own applications and projects.

- Request
```
{
  "reviews": "This movie was absolutely fantastic! I loved every moment of it."
}
```
- Response - model:[negative score, positive score]
```
{
    "logistic_regression": {[0.15, 0.85]},
    "complement_naive_bayes": {[0.18, 0.82]},
    "xgboost": {[0.13, 0.87]}
}
```
